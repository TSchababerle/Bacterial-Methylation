# Bacterial-Methylation
This repository contains two bash scripts for bacterial genome assembly, one lsf file for methylation calling using ONT's Dorado basecaller, one bash script for methylome assembly, and one R script for analyzing and plotting the methylated fractions. 

Genome Assembly: The hybrid assembly bash script is designed to process Illumina paired-end short reads along with ONT long reads, and the long read assembly bash script only processes long reads. These two scripts will perform QC analysis on your reads, assemble the genomes, polish the genomes, perform QC on the genomes, and annotate the genomes. 

Methylation Calling: The methylation calling lsf file is designed to process raw ONT pod5 files into demultiplexed, unaligned .bam files and then rename them from the barcode number to the replicate ID. We used the tool MicrobeMod to get methylation site calls, motifs, and restriction modification gene output from our bacterial strains. The link to the MicrobeMod github is (https://github.com/cultivarium/MicrobeMod). The bash script for methylome assembly is designed to take both hybrid and long-read only assemblies in .fasta format and run the MicrobeMod pipeline on them. This includes alignment of methylation uBAM files to the reference hybrid or long-read only genome, running the MicrobeMod call methylation pipeline, and running the MicrobeMod annotate restriction modification systems pipeline.

Methylated Fraction: The methylated fraction analysis R script is designed to perfrom 66 pairwise comparisons of the UT9728 ORA replicate assemblies for site-wise methylated fractions. It filters the MicrobeMod methylation site tables to only contain genomic position, sequence context, strand, motif, coverage, and the fraction of reads methylated. Analyses were restricted to the GATC motif, which was abundant across replicates and provided sufficient statistical power for reproducibility analysis. Replicates were aligned on the sequence field—which listed the motif sequence context—with strand information used to disambiguate duplicate contexts. In cases of multiple matches, genomic position was used as a secondary criterion, with a ±5 bp tolerance applied to account for minor positional jitter between assemblies. 
For each of the 66 replicate pairs, the absolute difference in methylated fraction was calculated for all matched sites. Sites were classified as discordant when the difference exceeded 0.15, a threshold derived from the global mean methylation fraction (~0.85) to focus on biologically meaningful outliers. Pairwise comparisons were visualized as scatter plots of methylated fractions, with discordant sites highlighted, and the proportion of discordant sites was summarized across all replicates in a heatmap. To assess technical contributions, local coverage differences were also computed, and coverage scatterplots were used to examine the relationship between sequencing depth and discordance.
