# Bacterial-Methylation
This repository contains two bash scripts for bacterial genome assembly. The hybrid assembly bash script is designed to process Illumina paired-end short reads along with ONT long reads, and the long read assembly bash script only processes long reads. These two scripts will perform QC analysis on your reads, assemble the genomes, polish the genomes, perform QC on the genomes, and annotate the genomes. The link to the MicrobeMod github is (https://github.com/cultivarium/MicrobeMod), the pipeline outlined was followed exactly to generate methylation output using these assemblies.
